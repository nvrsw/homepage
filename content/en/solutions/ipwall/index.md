## Differences from Normal Video Wall Systems

- It is simple and stable that requires only display server, unlike the normal configuration that requires a lot of equipment such as NVR, CMS, display server, encoder, controller, etc.
- It is possible to maintain expansion and performance by adding display server only, unlike normal equipment that requires excessive replacement or expansion of main equipment when additional monitors are added or expanded. 
- Multi-user and user-specific permission setting support
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- One-click operation of preset functions such as preset and screen rotation function

## Various Monitor Layout Configuration

In addition to the regular horizontal and vertical arrays, both monitor combinations and atypical monitor arrays of different sizes are supported.

Unlike the existing video wall system, which does not support expansion when adding a wall monitor or degrades after expansion, the system can be expanded by adding a display server and supports the same performance.
